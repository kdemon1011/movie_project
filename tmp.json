    "reviewBody": "You have already watched this, right? It is really easy to understand the love for this movie. I&apos;ll admit, when it comes to movie adaptations of books, the book is always better. How can it not be? You get way more detail than could be crammed into a two-hour movie. However, I still thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation. Yes, it does deviate from the short a little with character changes and omissions, but I don&apos;t think this film could have been any better. I am in line with the ten-star reviews that I&apos;m seeing and the only reason I am not giving this parable for hope a ten myself is because I don&apos;t as a rule. Hope, aspiration, fighting the system, justice and humanism against the tyranny of the mainstream society/religion. This is the film.",
